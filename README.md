The game is about stopping pirate chickens from attacking your settlement, you can use cannons for defense and the platforms/jump-pads to traverse water.
This game was made by Team Radiance - A collection of 3 artists and 3 programmers from Media Design School.

For this game I worked on the placement system that allows us to place platforms and cannons in the world, the functionality for the cannons, and general tasks such as bug fixing, UI and gameplay.
