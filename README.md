# About me
My name is Anton Le Prevost-Smith.
I'm a 24 year old software engineer and game developer in my final term of university.

I love working with other people to solve problems and make some pretty cool things - such as games!

I'm experienced in using C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity.
This is my portfolio for some of the programming and game development work I have done during my degree.

(I have still yet to add all the work I've done so please excuse me if it seems pretty lackluster at the moment)

# Portfolio-of-Work (WIP)


### Fluid Simulation Research - Prototype game
<p align="center">
  <img title="" src="https://github.com/Alps709/Alps709/blob/master/Media/Playtest.gif"/>
</p>
I developed a prototype of a 2D multiplayer combat game that uses fluid simulation as it’s core game mechanic. I used a Unity plugin called Fluid Dynamics to simulate the fluid and I successfully learned how it worked so I could extend it’s functionality to do what I wanted such as detect collisions with the player characters. I am currently finishing a short research paper discussing the game design and technical implementation of fluid simulation in games.


### Advanced Graphics showcase
<p align="center">

</p>
For one of my university projects I developed a showcase of different graphics techniques in my custom rendering engine that uses C++ and the OpenGL graphics API.
[A video of the different graphics techniques I implemented can be found here](https://youtu.be/ZAtfRSMvaL0).

Some features / techniques showcased are: 
•	Procedural terrain generation using noise. 
•	Varying terrain level of detail based on distance using a tessellation shader.
•	Varying grass level of detail on the terrain using the geometry shader. 
•	Particle system that can render millions of particles using compute shaders.


### Yanet in Yonderland
<p align="center">
  <img title="" src="https://github.com/Alps709/Alps709/blob/master/Media/Yanet In Yonderland.png"/>
</p>
A 2D platforming puzzel game created in my first year of University with a team of 4 other people (2 programmers, 2 artists).
A license to use the game was sold to [CoolMathGames.com](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-yanet-in-yonderland), which since been rated 4.2/5 with over 3000 votes.
I programmed the main puzzel mechanics, the companion AI and designed some of the puzzles for the game.


### Radiant Shores
Radiant shores is a Pre-Alpha wave defense game created in Unreal Engine.

[Gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JjRdtMopVE&feature=emb_logo)

The game is about stopping pirate chickens from attacking your settlement, you can use cannons for defense and the platforms/jump-pads to traverse water.
This game was made by Team Radiance - A collection of 3 artists and 3 programmers from Media Design School.

For this game I worked on the platform highlight and placement system that allows us to place platforms and cannons in the world, I also worked on the functionality for the autonomous cannons, and general tasks such as bug fixing, UI and gameplay.

### [Noir](https://ourlittlestudio.itch.io/noir)
Noir is a 2.5D platforming game created in Unreal Engine.  

You play as a soul trying to pass on into the after life. You must stay within the light to not fade into darkness. Platform your way through a castle full of trials to be able to pass on into the afterlife.
This game was made by Team Radiance - A collection of 3 artists and 3 programmers from Media Design School.

For this game I worked on the cat and its light based health system, the double jump, and other general work such as bug fixing, level design, and particle effects.

### Rapid Game Prototypes
I collaborated in a team of 6 people to develop 4 different 1 week long game prototypes as well as, 3 different 2 week long game prototypes. 
I was one of the two lead programmers for all prototypes, as well as a designer. My design work was mainly towards game ideas and mechanics, and my programming work was mainly towards implementation of game mechanics and other general developement tasks such as code refactoring, bug fixing etc. 

#### 1 Week long Prototypes:

•	Noir: Detailed Above (also worked on for another 4 weeks in a Mini-Production stage).

•	Muchicken: A 3D golf game that required the player to swich the seasons of the weather to clear the path of the ball.

•	Mu: A 3D, platforming game where the player uses a grappling hook to swing across the level to the goal.

•	Radiant Shores: Detailed Above (also worked on for another 4 weeks in a Mini-Production stage).

#### 2 Week long Prototypes:

•	[SousChef:](https://ourlittlestudio.itch.io/sous-chef) 3D monster hunter game with simple combat, this game is about a chef that hunts monster vegetables to cook.

•	Beastiary: A 3D Cooking/potion-brewing game about experimenting with monster ingredients to discover potion recipes.

•	Robot Rush: A 3D party combat/racing game, where players have unique constantly changing abilities that mess with other players.
