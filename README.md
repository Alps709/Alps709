# About me
My name is Anton Le Prevost-Smith.
I'm a 23 year old software engineer and game developer in my last year of university.

I love working with other people to solve problems and make some pretty cool things - such as games!

I'm experienced in using C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity.
This is my portfolio for all the programming and game development work I have done during my degree.

(I have still yet to add all the work I've done so please excuse me if it seems pretty lackluster at the moment)

The game is about stopping pirate chickens from attacking your settlement, you can use cannons for defense and the platforms/jump-pads to traverse water.
This game was made by Team Radiance - A collection of 3 artists and 3 programmers from Media Design School.

For this game I worked on the placement system that allows us to place platforms and cannons in the world, the functionality for the cannons, and general tasks such as bug fixing, UI and gameplay.

Noir is a 2.5D platforming game created in Unreal Engine.  

You play as a soul trying to pass on into the after life. You must stay within the light to not fade into darkness. Platform your way through a castle full of trials to be able to pass on into the afterlife.
This game was made by Team Radiance - A collection of 3 artists and 3 programmers from Media Design School.

For this game I worked on the cat and its light based health system, the double jump, and other general work such as bug fixing, level design, and particle effects.

### Rapid Game Prototypes
I collaborated in a team of 6 people to develop 4 different 1 week long game prototypes as well as, 3 different 2 week long  game prototypes. 
I was one of the two lead programmers for all prototypes, as well as a designer. My design work was mainly towards game ideas and mechanics, and my programming work was mainly towards implementation of game mechanics and other general developement tasks such as code refactoring, bug fixing etc. 

#### 1 Week long Prototypes:

•	Noir: A 2.5D platforming game that required the player to stay within the light to survive.

•	Muchicken: A 3D golf game that required the player to swich the seasons of the weather to clear the path of the ball.

•	Mu: A 3D, platforming game where the player uses a grappling hook to swing across the level to the goal.

•	Radiant Shores: (detailed above).

#### 2 Week long Prototypes:

•	SousChef: 3D monster hunter game with simple combat, this game is about a chef that hunts monster vegetables to cook.

•	Beastiary: A 3D Cooking/potion brewing game about experimenting with monster ingredients to discover potion recipes.

•	Robot Rush: A 3D party racing game, where players have unique constantly changing abilities that mess with other players.
