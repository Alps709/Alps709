# About me
My name is Anton Le Prevost-Smith.
I'm a 23 year old software engineer and game developer in my last year of university.

I love working with other people to solve problems and make some pretty cool things - such as games!

I'm experienced in using C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity.
This is my portfolio for all the programming and game development work I have done during my degree.

(I have still yet to add all the work I've done so please excuse me if it seems pretty lackluster at the moment)

The game is about stopping pirate chickens from attacking your settlement, you can use cannons for defense and the platforms/jump-pads to traverse water.
This game was made by Team Radiance - A collection of 3 artists and 3 programmers from Media Design School.

For this game I worked on the placement system that allows us to place platforms and cannons in the world, the functionality for the cannons, and general tasks such as bug fixing, UI and gameplay.

Noir is a 2.5D platforming game made in Unreal Engine.  

You play as a soul trying to pass on into the after life. You must stay within the light to not fade into darkness. Platform your way through a castle full of trials to be able to pass on into the afterlife.
